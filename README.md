I'm Jad, and I'm studying Computer Science with a minor in Operations Research at Columbia University (class of 2026).

My interests include software engineering, cybersecurity, data science, and AI. 

Currently, I am working on a data science project to make a model that predicts the outcome of soccer penalty kicks, 
and taking the Google Cybersecurity Certificate alongside my sophomore classes.
